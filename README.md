## Kenneth McInturf Coding Test

Thanks for giving the opportunity to continue in the interview process! This was a really fun project, and I am excited to show y'all  my solution for challenge 4, hidden-word puzzle solver. 

### Running the App
- Clone the project from this repo into your machine
- Navigate into the repo in your local machine, and run `composer install`
- Run `npm run dev` to compile the Vue Components
- I just put a local server up for deployment. Running `php artisan serve` will allow you to run the app locally from `<http://127.0.0.1:8000>`

## Application Overview
- Users can enter comma seperated strings, representing the different puzzles and solutions, in both of the input boxes on the page. Default values are the examples inputs from the problem
- Once values are set, press submit, and the solution will be displayed underneath the form after the application finishes processing inputs
- For larger data sets, users can Import a `.json` file, with up to 316 lines each being 316 characters long. For your testing, I have included a file, `BigPuzzle.json`, in the root directory of the project

## Conclusion
Thanks again for taking the time to review this project, and to speak with me about Wright/Ringo. I look forward to any feedback from this project, and hope to speak with y'all again soon!
